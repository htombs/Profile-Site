        <p>Since the age of 16 I've been working in customer facing roles, starting out at Currys Electrical store. From here
            I took an interest in helping people and foudn a passion in outdoor activites such. This inevitablty led me to study 
            Outdoor Leisure at Bicton college, where I gained a National Diploma and found my passion of teaching my hobbies</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using this skill and the oportunities that come with it, some of the activities I've taught have been kayaking,
             climbing, Mountain biking, snowboarding, among many others in multiple locations including France, Wales and Austria 
             using my communication and professional skills to learn how best to communicate 444444444444444with different cultures.
