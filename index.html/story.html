        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Since the age of 16 I've been working in customer facing roles, starting out at Currys Electrical store. From here
            I took an interest in helping people and foudn a passion in outdoor activites such. This inevitablty led me to study 
            Outdoor Leisure at Bicton college, where I gained a National Diploma and found my passion of teaching my hobbies</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using this skill and the oportunities that come with it, for the next part of my life I travelled as much as possible,
            wanting to instruct in as many different countries as possible and explore the world. Some of the activities I've taught
            have been kayaking, climbing, Mountain biking, Snowboarding and archery, among many others in multiple locations 
            including France, Wales and Austria. using my communication and professional skills to learn how best to communicate with different cultures accross 
            multiple languages
