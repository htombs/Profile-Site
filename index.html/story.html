        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Since the age of 16 I've been working in customer facing roles, starting out at Currys Electrical store. From here
            I took an interest in helping people and foudn a passion in outdoor activites such. This inevitablty led me to study 
            Outdoor Leisure at Bicton college, where I gained a National Diploma and found my passion of teaching my hobbies</p>
            <br>
        <p>Using this skill and the oportunities that come with it, for the next part of my life I travelled as much as possible,
            wanting to instruct in as many different countries as possible and explore the world. Some of the activities I've taught
            have been Kayaking, Climbing, Mountain biking, Snowboarding and StandUp Paddleboarding, among many others in multiple locations 
            including France, Wales and Austria</p>
            <br>    
        <p>After several years instructing and travelling the world, I chose to make a base for myself in Exeter and start saving for 
            wedding. To do this I took a job at my local bike shop Saddles and Paddles where I've spent the last 8 years of my career
            building my way up to Manager, which I have done for the last 4 years. This last role I an particualy passionate about, it 
            gives me the oportunity to engage with the pubic and help where I can, but then also turn my hand to more technical and 
            problem solving issues that go with bicycle mechanics</p>
            <br>
        <p>I'm now at a point in my life where I've reached my personal and finacial limit (the bike industry is fun in the bike trade and am looking for another challenge. After talking
            at length with friends in the tech world, I feel this would give me the personal challenge I'm looking for in the next 
            stage of my professional life
        </p>
