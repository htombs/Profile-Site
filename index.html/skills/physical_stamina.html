        <li>I love being physically active, whether it's mountain biking with friends, surfing 
            with the family, or taking our 5 year old sprocker for a wander through the woods.
            Previously that has involved finding jobs where I'm constantly outside or instructing 
            outdoor sports. More recently though I've really enjoyed taking part in sporting events 
            as a way to push my body to it's limits. Cycling events are the big draw for me as it's 
            my main passion, it's never been about the competitive side of the event that's intrigued me,
            more the personal challenge to see if I can complete such a challenge.

        <li class="skills_li">In March 2020 I took part in a 24 mile mountain bike event across the Isle of Wight called the 7 hills. 
            (Aptly named for climbing and descending all 7 major hills on the island).
        </li>
        <li class="skills_li">Later in November 20220 I participated in a XC mountain bike race. This was a lot more competitive
            and therefor was not as fun, I enjoy the persoanl challenge more than anything.
        </li>
        <li class="skills_li">In October 2021 I took part in a charity 5k run called "The Muddy Dog Challenge". As the name
            suggests, it was a running event with your dog across Escot Estate in Devon through many
            muddy puddles and obstacle courses, all in need of Battersea Dogs Trust.
        </li>
        <li class="skills_li">In August 2022, as part of a group of friends also in the bike trade, we cycled from Bristol to Exeter (a 
            total of 133 miles) throughout the night, starting at 7pm and finishing at 11am. We did this once again
            in 2023 to see if we could complete it in a better time.
