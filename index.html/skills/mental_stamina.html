        <li>More recently
            I've taken part in several long distance cycle events that take place overnight. This 
            requires a mental skill to push through any doubting thoughts of giving up and a mental 
            power to keep pushing through any barriers that arise. Having spent 16 years in customer service,
            I've also built up a strong mental will that only comes with serving the public on a daily
            basis.</li>
            <br>
        <li>My recent decision to enter the world of programming has taken a huge amount of mental stamina, often 
            working into the evenings and my days off, I've often felt the strain of learning a new skill that's
            so mentally challenging. This, along with trying to work a full time job and raise a family has 
            been particulary difficult, but it is something I'm passionate about and want to pursue a career in.
            Beyond all that, I've actully enjoyed the challenge and have loved discovering how a web page is built 
            and progressing furthur in programming.</li>
