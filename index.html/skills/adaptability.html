    <ul class="skills_ul">
        <li>Adaptabilty is a skill I genuinly believe to be incredibly important to succeed 
            in both a career and life. My entire proffesional life has been anything but routine,
            often finding myself in high pressure situations where everything can go wrong and 
            you have to think on your feet. I've always loved the saying: "Hope for the best, plan 
            for the worst" and I've taken that with me in every work place I've been. When 
            instructing climbing, kayaking or mountain biking, there's so much room for error 
            and if you're not able to adapt to your situation, you'll often find it get's a lot
            worse before it gets better. It was the same at Saddles and Paddles, when running a 
            bike shop/workshop/hire center, there are multiple angles and situations where quick
            decisions need to be made, and I've always prided myself on my ability to 
            disassociate myself above the situation and rationally think of all the possible outcomes,
            and from there work out which outcome is most efficient and some times cost-effective.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>In a more recent example, I've turned my hand to programming. Now for someone like me, 
            who has always aimed for physical employment, the world of programming seemed like a 
            whole new language completely beyond my comprehension. But with a goal in mind, I've 
            adapted and learnt and like to believe I've found myself at a reasonably competent 
            level in an incredibly short period of time. I've become fairly competent with 
            <p>html</p>, <p>css</p> and <p>javascript</p>, with the hopes of progressing 
            further in these languages and also building my skills with <p>python</p>. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I know I'm still new to the programming world, but I believe with my ability to quickly learn and 
            adapt to new environments, I'll be a valuable asset where ever my career takes me.
        </li>
