            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>Whether leading an activity session or running a business for 4 years, I pride
                myself on being able to communicate with others and motivate them to get the 
                best prossible perfomance. This has often been with a, "lead from the front"
                aproach, where I never feel comfortable asking others to do somehting I haven't 
                myself

            <h3>Adaptabilty</h3>
            <p>I've shown incredible skill to adapt to the situation, where that involves dealing 
                with a medical emergency while on canoeing session, or my ability to learn 
                programming to a competent point in a short space of time</p>

            <h3>Physical Stamina</h3>
            <p>I demonstrated on multiple occasions I'm physically fit enough, taking part in 
                many cycling events and turning my hand to all activities offered to me.

            <h3>Mental Stamina</h3>
            <p>More recently
                I've taken part in several long distance cycle events that take place overnight. This 
                requires a mental skill to push through any doubting thoughts of giving up and a mental 
                power to keep pushing through the pain. With my recent decision to enter the world of 
                programming, I've found myself staring at a computer screen for long periods of time, 
                often feeling the mental strain of learning a new skill that's not physical. To my surprise,
                I've actully enjoyed the challenge and love watching how a web page is built and learning all
                these new skills
